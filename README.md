# HTML-CSS Notes

ARIA Roles provide the necessary tools to make your site accessible to everyone.

Enhance readability by adding comments.

Best practice to use lowercase for html all elements.

The length of an element name indicates how old it is. back in the day, RAM was small, say space was prioritized.

Character entities come in handy when you need to type characters that are not available on your keyboard.
"&nbsp;" to keep 2 words together and avoid line break between them, or create more than one space betweeen words.

To create a link, we use the A element, which stands for anchor. Between the opening and closing A tags, we can place text or images, or both, to make them clickable.
HTTP/S stands for Hypertext Transport Protocol/Secure.
When linking to something within the same siteas the page containing the link, a relative URL can be used instead.
To create a relative URL, omit the domain name but include the initial slash at the beginning.
Relative URLs are based on the current file's location, while absolute URLs start from the root of the website.
